# NYT Project Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the NYT project on your local machine. Before you begin, ensure you have Git and Node.js installed on your computer.

## Steps to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kedarnath1999/NYT.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the cloned repository directory and install the required Node.js modules:

```bash
cd NYT
npm install
```

### 3. Create a New York Times Developer Account

To access the New York Times API, you need to create a developer account. Please follow the link and sign up for an account:

[https://developer.nytimes.com/](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

After creating your NYT developer account and obtaining your API key, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your API key and the port number for the application. 

Create a `.env` file and add the following content, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual NYT API key:

```
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
PORT=3000
```

### 5. Start the Application

With the environment variables set, you're ready to start the application. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 3000). You can access the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
